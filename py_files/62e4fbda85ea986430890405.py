		-o is used to specify a file containing input lines.
		-0 is used to indicate that the input data is separated by null characters (NULs).
		-I is used to specify a pattern for substituting into command arguments.
		-I can be specified multiple times, but only one will be substituted at a time.
		-P is used to specify the number of simultaneous processes to run.
		-P can be specified multiple times, but only one will be run at a time.

		Note: -P option does not work with -I option

		Example:

			xargs -P 4 -I {} echo "Hello World" > /dev/null

		Here, 4 concurrent processes will run simultaneously and each process will replace "{}"
		with its own value from the list of values provided as input.

		Also note that if you want to use -P option then you have to provide all the values as input
		and not just some of them.

		For example:

			xargs -P 4 -I {} echo "Hello World" > /dev/null < input.txt

		Here, input.txt should contain all the values which you want to pass as input to the command.

		But if you do something like this:

			xargs -P 4 -I {} echo "Hello World" > /dev/null < input.txt

		Then it will throw error because it expects all the values to be passed as input.

		To overcome this problem we can use -0 option which tells xargs to read input from standard input
		in NUL delimited format.

		For example:

			xargs -P 4 -I {} -0 echo "Hello World" > /dev/null < input.txt

		Now, input.txt should contain all the values which you want to pass as input to the command.

		But if you do something like this:

			xargs -P 4 -I {} -0 echo "Hello World" > /dev/null < input.txt

		Then it will throw error because it expects all the values
