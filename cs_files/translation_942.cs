1. Create a hash function based on the load factor. The hash function should have a high load factor to ensure that the hash table is not too small or too large. 2. Use the hash function to determine the index of the first bucket in the hash table. 3. Insert each key-value pair into the hash table using the hash function. If the hash function returns the same index for multiple keys, use chaining or open addressing to resolve collisions.
